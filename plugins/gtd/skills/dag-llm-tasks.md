# DAG LLM Tasks

The daily review executes `Personal > 🔄 Review > 🔄 Daily Review > LLM Tasks:` as a dependency DAG. Tree placement defines execution phase, identical task names link prep work to presentation, and optional markers add only the information that placement cannot express.

## Canonical tree

```text
LLM Tasks:
  Import
    op run -- just daily
    ./bin/run.js cache sync-node --id <full-uuid> --recursive
  Prep
    Serial: Calendar journal
      Otter journal <time...>
        /gtd:otter-journal-auto
        Auto
      Refine calendar journal <time...>
        /gtd:refine-journal-prep
    Process inbox <time...>
      /gtd:refine-inbox
    Time Machine exclusions <time...>
      /gtd:time-machine-exclusions-prep
  Presentation
    Refine calendar journal
      /gtd:refine-journal-apply
    Process inbox
      /gtd:inbox
    Time Machine exclusions
      /gtd:time-machine-exclusions-apply
```

The schema is strict:

- Root children are exactly `Import`, `Prep`, and `Presentation`.
- Every prep task has one plugin command and one `<time>` element.
- A paired presentation task has the identical date-stripped name and no date.
- The prep command supplies the artifact slug after removing a trailing `-prep` or `-auto`; presentation inherits that slug.
- `Interval: <amount><unit>` is optional on prep and defaults to `1d`; units are `d`, `m`, and `y`.
- `Auto` marks prep that completes without presentation. Auto task names must not appear under `Presentation`.
- `Serial: <name>` groups prep tasks that must run top-to-bottom. Other direct children of `Prep` are independent parallel branches.
- Do not add `Key:`, `#llm-task`, `prep`, `apply`, or marker emoji to task names or children; names, commands, placement, and optional markers already carry that information.

Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/compute-llm-dag.mjs` before execution. Its output is the authoritative `.llm/gtd/review/phase0-plan.json`; validation failure halts the review.

## Scheduling

Only prep nodes own schedules. The planner compares each prep date to today, includes the linked presentation entry when prep is due, and precomputes the next date from today plus the task interval.

After verified success, the main executor runs the task's `advance.applyOp` from the plan verbatim. Task commands never advance their own date. Empty prep is successful; skipped, failed, and unverified work leaves the date unchanged.

This central ownership prevents prep and presentation dates from drifting and supports daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly prep/apply tasks with the same mechanism.

## Import barrier

Run every instruction under `Import` inline. Do not pipe the commands through `head` or `tail`. Confirm the API import reports its fetched and changed node counts and verify current data is present. Drain pending background writes before the import and before prep fan-out.

If freshness cannot be positively verified, halt.

## Prep fan-out

Before dispatching anything, **stop prep controllers left over from an earlier or aborted fan-out**. List the running background agents and terminate any prep controller that is not part of this dispatch. A restarted review otherwise stacks new controllers on top of live ones: the five-in-flight cap stops being real, and a controller presumed hung can wake up hours later and overwrite the artifact a retry already staged — silently replacing the proposals the walk is mid-way through presenting. Treat a controller that stops answering a status ping as still dangerous until it is actually stopped, not merely assumed dead.

Run metadata sync once before fan-out. Prep workers read the resulting `.llm/gtd/metadata/` cache and never rebuild it concurrently.

Dispatch one background controller per due branch from the plan:

- A `parallel` branch contains one independent task.
- A `serial` branch runs its due tasks in tree order, waiting for each before starting the next.
- Keep at most five prep controllers in flight.

Each prep worker is autonomous, never prompts, and stages `.llm/gtd/review/proposals/<slug>.json`. Auto workers complete their autonomous work and stage `.llm/gtd/review/briefings/<slug>.json`.

## Presentation walk

Begin presentation as soon as prep controllers are running. Walk the plan's presentation array in order and wait only for the current task's staged result. Later slow work must not delay an earlier ready task.

Apply commands read their staged result and return one of:

- success: work is verified; the executor dispatches the task's date operation.
- empty: nothing needed attention; the executor dispatches the date operation without prompting.
- skipped: the user deferred the work; the date stays unchanged.
- failure: work or verification failed; halt and leave the date unchanged.

Continue reaping prep controllers and background date writes throughout the walk.

## Shared-state safeguards

- Run metadata sync once; prep workers only read it.
- Drain every pending write before an import or cache rewrite.
- Serialize tasks that write the same Workflowy subtree.
- Keep parallel branches on distinct write targets.
- Use the plan's presentation order, never completion race order.
- Report a pending task and elapsed time when its prep delays presentation.
- Fetch only required fields and redirect deep trees to `.llm/` rather than placing them in agent context.

## Completion

Drain prep controllers and every date write before relinking. Surface failures by task name. Summarize applied, empty, skipped, failed, and advanced tasks, then append auto briefing lines.
