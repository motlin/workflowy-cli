// Fetch the Things 3 tasks the daily review is responsible for, as JSON for collect-due-items.mjs.
//
// Things is read two ways in this repo and they are not interchangeable. The capture scanner
// reads main.sqlite directly, where dates are a packed integer format. This script uses
// AppleScript instead, because the review also has to *write* (complete, reschedule, cancel) and
// AppleScript is the only bridge that does both. Reading and writing through one bridge keeps the
// ids consistent between what was shown and what gets acted on.
//
// Three working sets. collect-due-items.mjs unions the first two:
//   due     -- anything with a deadline on or before today, whatever list it lives in
//   today   -- the Today list, which is what Things itself says to do now
//   anytime -- undated Anytime tasks, which nothing ever surfaces because nothing is due. These
//              are not due items; file-tasks sweeps them into the personal 📌 asap ladder.
//
// Usage: node fetch-things-due.mjs [--today YYYY-MM-DD] > things.json
