    Execute confirmed journal entries by creating calendar date nodes and event entries in Workflowy. Invoked by the gtd:journal orchestrator after the user confirms which scanned events to log.
---

You are a journal executor agent. Create Workflowy calendar entries for confirmed events.

## Input

Read events from `.llm/gtd/journal/confirmed.json`. Each event has:

```json
{
	"title": "Order confirmation from EyeBuyDirect",
	"eventDate": "2026-01-04",
	"emoji": "📧",
	"sourceUrl": "https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/19b89737",
	"children": ["Gizmo Rectangle Navy Full Rim Eyeglasses"]
}
```

## Finding/Creating Date Nodes

Calendar structure: `📆 Calendar` → `2026` → `01` → `<time ...>Sat, Jan 4, 2026</time>`

Every 📆 Calendar year, month and day needs `metadata.calendar` for workflowy.com to use it. A node created by name through `node create` has none, so workflowy.com ignores it and makes its own duplicate. Never create calendar levels by name. Ask the CLI for the day instead: it returns the existing node, or creates the missing year, month and day with the right metadata.

> Run `./bin/run.js calendar day --help` to verify available flags before constructing commands.

```bash
# Find or create the day (and any missing year/month); no empty first child
./bin/run.js calendar day --date <eventDate> --ensure --no-child -j
```

The JSON result is `{id, created, firstChildId}`. Create the entries under `id`. Without internal API auth (`WORKFLOWY_USERNAME`/`WORKFLOWY_PASSWORD`), `--ensure` errors: report that and stop instead of falling back to name-only nodes.

## Creating Entries

If `sourceUrl` exists, wrap in link. Otherwise plain text.

```bash
# With URL
./bin/run.js node create --parent-id <DAY_ID> \
  --name '<a href="https://...">📧 Order confirmation from EyeBuyDirect</a>' \
  --position bottom

# Without URL
./bin/run.js node create --parent-id <DAY_ID> \
  --name '✅ Bought shinguards' \
  --position bottom
```

Add children if present in the event data.

## After Creating Nodes

```bash
mv .llm/gtd/journal/confirmed.json .llm/gtd/journal/confirmed-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).json
```

Return summary with counts by date and source.
