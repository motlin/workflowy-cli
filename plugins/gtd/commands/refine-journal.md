name: refine-journal
description: Refine calendar journal entries (people, hobby, category, typo, emoji tags) one month at a time. Standalone wrapper that chains the prep and apply halves. Use when the user wants to refine, tag, or clean up their calendar journal / past activity log outside the daily review.

# Refine Journal

This command was split into two focused halves so the daily review's Phase 0 DAG can run the autonomous compute in parallel and defer the interactive confirmation:

- **`/gtd:refine-journal-prep`** — load metadata, scan the next month, compute people/hobby/category/typo/emoji refinements, and stage them to `.llm/gtd/review/proposals/refine-journal.json`. Mutates no nodes; does not advance Scanner-State.
- **`/gtd:refine-journal-apply`** — read the staged file, walk the batches-of-4 confirmation loop, apply accepted updates, and advance Scanner-State. The daily-review executor owns scheduling.

For a standalone manual run, invoke them in order: run `/gtd:refine-journal-prep`, then `/gtd:refine-journal-apply`.

## Archive backfill is opt-in, and this is where you ask for it

Prep defaults to **recent mode** — the current and prior live calendar months only. The backwards archive walk runs only when the invocation asks for it, and the daily review never does; almost every archive proposal was "this old entry lacks a leading emoji", which buried the handful of real fixes on recent entries.

To backfill history, say so when invoking this command (`/gtd:refine-journal archive`, or name a month). Prep then also scans the next month backwards from `last_completed_month`, and apply gates that block behind its own confirmation before touching anything.

The on-disk contract both halves share is documented in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/review-proposal-staging.md`.
