description: Clean up completed items under both ✅ Tasks roots — for each one, un-complete it and move it into the 📅 Calendar on its completion date (the journal), or delete it permanently. Use when the user wants to clear finished tasks out of the next-actions trees or run the cleanup-completed phase of the daily review.

# Clean Up Completed Tasks

Completed items linger under `✅ Tasks` in both roots (`Personal > ☑️ Next (Personal)` and `Work > ☑️ Next (Work)`), inside the `⏰` bucket, the `📌` tiers, or loose beside them. Every one is either a record of something done, which belongs in the journal, or noise, which should go. This phase asks which, one item at a time.

## Do not use the built-in task list

Track progress inline and in `.llm/` files. Do not create `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` / `TodoWrite` tasks.

## Safety

- Never act on an item the user has not answered for. No batch default, no auto-delete.
- Delete is permanent, so it is never the promoted answer and never preselected.
- Surface every failed write instead of continuing past it, and never suppress output of a write.
- Resolve every target from the real roots, never from a mirror (see the mirror rule in `file-tasks.md`).

## Collect

Fetch both roots deep enough to reach the tiers, then collect the completed items:

```bash
./bin/run.js node get --path "Personal,☑️ Next (Personal)" --depth 6 --json \
  --fields id,name,completedAt,children > .llm/gtd/review/completed-personal.json
./bin/run.js node get --path "Work,☑️ Next (Work)" --depth 6 --json \
  --fields id,name,completedAt,children > .llm/gtd/review/completed-work.json
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/collect-completed-tasks.mts \
  Personal=.llm/gtd/review/completed-personal.json \
  Work=.llm/gtd/review/completed-work.json > .llm/gtd/review/completed-rows.json
```

Each row carries `root`, `id`, `name`, `completedAt`, `completedDate` (the local calendar date), `path` (where it sits), and `childCount`. Only the top-most completed item of a subtree is a row; its children travel with it. `📋 Meeting agendas` is outside the `✅ Tasks` wrapper and is never collected.

Silent when there are no rows.

## Walk

Ask one question per row, oldest `completedDate` first, with these outcomes:

- **Journal** — promoted when the item records something done that the user would want to remember (an errand, a conversation, a purchase, a filed form). Un-complete it, then move it under the root's `📅 Calendar` date node for `completedDate`.
- **Delete** — permanent removal, for noise (a reminder to self, a duplicate, a trivial check). Confirm before deleting any row with `childCount > 0`.
- **Skip** — leave it completed and untouched; it returns tomorrow.

Show the cleaned item name (markup and due `<time>` stripped), `completedDate`, and `path` in the question. Past a handful of rows, follow the long-walk rule in `daily.md` and use a decision page.

## Apply: Journal

Find the date node under the root's `📅 Calendar` whose `<time>` element matches `completedDate`:

```bash
./bin/run.js node get --path "<Personal|Work>,📅 Calendar" --depth 1 --json --fields id,name
```

If the date node is missing, create it with name `<time startYear="Y" startMonth="M" startDay="D">Ddd, Mmm D, YYYY</time>` under the Calendar node (the date format is described in `plugins/workflowy/skills/workflowy-html.md`), then resolve its full UUID. Then un-complete before moving, so the journal never holds a completed node:

```bash
./bin/run.js node uncomplete --id <rowId>
./bin/run.js node move --node-id <rowId> --parent-id <dateNodeId> -p bottom
```

If the item still carries a due-date `<time>` element, leave the text alone; the user edits entries in the journal, and the journal scanners treat the entry as past activity. An item with open children keeps them as they are.

## Apply: Delete

```bash
./bin/run.js node delete --id <rowId>
```

## Report

Report counts for journaled, deleted, and skipped, and list any failure. A failed move after a successful `uncomplete` leaves an incomplete item in the task tree, so retry the move or tell the user that item's name explicitly.

## Standalone use

Run the import barrier (`/gtd:daily-import`) first if the cache may be stale, since a stale cache lists items that were already moved.
