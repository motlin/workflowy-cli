 * leave another original's mirror outside the deleted part (inside the kept
 * subtree), so originals are rechecked until none changes. Originals are
 * checked breadth-first, and promotions run in the order they were found.
 *
 * With several candidate mirrors, the one with the lowest id (plain string
 * comparison) is used. The web app uses the first key of its in-memory
 * `mirrorRootIds`, which a fresh page load sorts by mirror id; verified live
 * against the web UI on 2026-09-30, where it disagreed with both outline and
 * creation order. A long-open tab can pick differently, since live-synced
 * mirrors are added to the front, so the fresh-load rule is the one followed.
